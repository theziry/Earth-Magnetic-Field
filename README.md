# Earth Magnetic Field
## Overview:

Very early in the study of the Earth’s magnetism, it had been realised that the magnetic field 𝐁 is changing with time. The proper description of this evolution came with the setting of magnetic observatories from the middle of the nineteenth century onward. The general assumption was that most of observed fast variations in 𝐁(t) were due to external fields perturbations, while the dominant core field varied slowly over time.

The accumulation of long time series of magnetic observations led to an evolution of this paradigm since, at observatory sites, the main field secular variation (SV), or rate of change of the field, 𝜕𝐁∕𝜕t ) often appeared as linear trends with abrupt changes of slopes. These singular events are clearly generated in the core and have been called $“geomagnetic jerks”$.
The evolution of this secular variation has also been studied in terms of secular acceleration (SA, or second time derivative, ${𝜕^2𝐁∕𝜕t^2}$).

The crucial issue regarding field models derived from magnetic data is their temporal resolution. Observatory time series show a temporal spectrum S(f) in the range of periods from ≈ 70 yrs down to a couple of years. This property, which is coherent with the existence of geomagnetic jerks, is also recovered in time series of the geomagnetic Gauss coefficients. 

# Project Description:

This project aims to study and model the Earth Magnetic Field Using Geomagnetic Observatory Data.

The remainder of this work is organised in three sections (three notebooks) as follows: 

## Section 1: Signal processing
### [1-EMF-Signal_Processing.ipynb](https://github.com/thiziriamezza/Earth-Magnetic-Field/blob/main/1-EMF-Signal_Processing.ipynb)

In this first notebook, I first started generating Synthetic timeseries data that contains a single harmonic component of period of $10 years$ sampled each month, than I deepen my analysis using real data; using long series of Chambon-la-Forêt $(CLF)$ observatory data which are monthly means, and discussing the observed Secular Variation evolutions over time.  

In both parts (synthetic and real), I performed a spectral analysis on the signals and applied a Butterworth filters: Collecting monthly samples and Smoothing by means of a suitable filter with the attempt to preserve as much information as possible in the frequency band. 

Looking through a finite duration ‘window’ at the signal (Regard as a multiplication in the time domain.), taking samples but the Fourier Transform is periodic. Therefore, to extract information at a particular frequency at least two samples per cycle must be taken, and this leads to the concept of the $Nyquist$ $frequency$ e.g. if the sampling rate is 10Hz, the maximum resolvable frequency is 5Hz. If there are higher frequencies present in the signal they are aliased – they masquerade as lower frequencies. 

To resolve a sinusoidal signal it must be sampled at least twice per cycle. If the sampling rate is $f_{samp}$ then the maximum resolvable frequency is the $Nyquist$ $frequency$: $f_n= f_{samp}/2$ (Ideally, select the sampling rate to be at least the Nyquist rate required to resolve the maximum frequency component of a signal.).
In practice a signal may not be band-limited. If the signal includes frequency $f$ and the sampling rate is $f_{samp}$ then the samples of signals at frequencies $f ± nf_{samp}$ are indistinguishable from $f_{sig}$  – they are ‘aliases’. Fourier analysis will put all the aliased signals at $f_{sig}$.


## Section 2: Data Visualisation
### [2-EMF-Observatory-Data-Visualisation.ipynb](https://github.com/thiziriamezza/Earth-Magnetic-Field/blob/main/2-EMF-Observatory-Data-Visualisation.ipynb)

The goal of this notebooK is to 

## Section 3: Modelling the Geomagnetic Field
### [3-Spherical-Harmonic-Models.ipynb](https://github.com/thiziriamezza/Earth-Magnetic-Field/blob/main/3-Spherical-Harmonic-Models%20.ipynb)

In this section, I build a model capable of representing my data

#### The International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF):
IGRF is An IAGA ‘flagship product’
- First produced 1965
- The International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) is a series of mathematical models describing the large-scale internal part of the Earth’s magnetic field between epochs 1900 A.D. and the present.
- The IGRF is used by scientists in studies of dynamics of the core field, space weather, local crustal magnetic field. It is also used by commercial organizations as a source of orientation information.
- The latest version is IGRF-13

#### IGRF – a collaborative effort:

IGRF-13 is a Main Field Models every 5 years from 1900 with Nmax = 10 to 1995 and Nmax = 13 for 2000 to 2020. D(efinitive)GRF up to 2015

\begin{equation}
V(r,${\theta}$,${\phi}$,t) = a${\sum_{n=1}^N_max}$ (${\frac{a}{r})^{n+1}}$${\sum_{m=0}^n}$(${g^m_n}$(t)cos(m${\phi}$) + ${h^m_n}$(t)sin(m${\phi}$))${P^m_n}$cos(${\theta}$) 
\end{equation}

(Nmax = 13 is chosen to avoid contamination by crustal fields)

IGRF-13:
- 11 candidate MF models for 2015 (DGRF).
- 12 candidate MF models for 2020 (IGRF).
- 14 candidate SV models for 2020-2025.
A scientific disadvantage is that it’s difficult to include uncertainty estimates for the Gauss coefficients.
